# Dead-Ops
Top-down single player zombie shooter created in Greenfoot.
Dead Ops was created with a team of four guys including myself in a software engineering class in Fall 2019.

Created by Isaac Weiss, Taz Caldwell, Nico Marthe, and Colin Vijvere

Shoot to kill zombies. One bullet flies with each click of the mouse. After a set number of kills per level, the level switches. Score, Cash, and Time are displayed in the top right of the screen. Time is reset for each level. Players have a health bar that is depleted when touching zombies and ends the game when it reachs zero.
